                <h2 id="about-me">Hello, World!</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi. I'm Morgan, and welcome to my personal career website. I am a computer scientist, entrepreneur, research scientist, data engineer, mathematician, and bold thinker. Read below to learn a bit about me..
 
                </p><p> 
                    <b>In the last several years,</b>
                    I have been training in Silicon Valley to become a 
                    groundbreaking scientist,
                    engineer, entrepreneur, and holistic 21st-century human. 
                    I am a currently finishing my Coterminal Master's 
                    degree in Symbolic Systems, with a Bachelor's of Science
                    in Computer Science (conferred), both at Stanford University.
                <p>  
                </p> 
                    Over this period, I have been focusing on training
                    my industry expertise in machine learning, 
                    software engineering, venture technology startups,
                    and scientific research and development.
                    As a Computer Science undergraduate I studied 
                    the principles, theory, 
                    engineering, and applications of software and computation. 
                    I further concentrated on statistics, 
                    artificial intelligence, and machine learning.
                    My academic work since undergrad lies in the fields of 
                    psychology, 
                    neuroscience, computational science, and mathematics. 
                </p> <p>  
                    <b>Most recently</b>, I 
                    have been working on my Master's thesis 
                    with Stanford's PDP lab on distributed theories
                    of human intelligence. To this end we use 
                    computational modeling and behavioral experiments as 
                    our core methodological tools. My 
                    primary research project focuses on how we learn,
                    use, and conceptualize spatial reference frames to understand
                    our environment, focusing especially on the roles of
                    curricula, attention, navigation, and planning.
                    Having finished the degree's coursework,
                    I have taken the opportunity to finish my thesis 
                    remotely to be with my family in our hometown, Chicago.

                Since 2019,
                I have been also studying quantum physics, molecular biology, and macroeconomics in both theoretic and application-based directions. I am finding success and invigoration in using my applied mathematics, computer science, and artificial intelligence skills to these domains.

                    my skills and interests in technology,
                    startups, and research. As of August 2020, I am searching for a salaried full-time job
                    as a data scientist at a tech startup in the Bay Area.

                    a related field, starting no sooner than 2024. 
                    <b>In the far future</b>,

                    This combination of roles will make the best use 
                    of my specialized technical skillset, 
                    deep and broad knowledge of innovative, advanced technology, and my unrivaled knack for

                <u>If you're new to genderfluidity</u>:
                    In my own words, a <i>transgender</i> person is someone who was assigned one gender at birth but experiences life as another gender. "Cis" means "not-trans". A cisgender woman was assigned female at birth and has identified strongly with being a woman ever since, implicitly or explicitly. <i>Non-binary</i> refers to individuals who are neither male nor female, agnostic to whether the person is cisgender nor transgender. Logically, the conventional sexuality terms gay, straight, etc. make little or no sense with nonbinary identities. The term <i>genderfluid</i>, a kind of non-binary identity, often applies to individuals whose gender varies and fluctuates between transgender-cisgender or between male-female, regardless of assigned-at-birth gender. Genderfluid and nonbinary are generally inaccurate terms for a binary trans person who is, say, early in the process of transitioning and/or might seem androgynous to someone else.
 Genderfluid identies can fall under the umbrella identities Non-binary, Queer, and LGBTQ+. 
                    For many genderfluid people, their gender changes on its own accord regardless of my will or any external factors. One way to understand this is thinking of gender as a 'set point' (my own term). Most people's set points are fixed all one side or another, such as 100% connected to being male experiences and 0% congruent with a female identity (100%M-0%F). When a person's interaction and experience with the world is distant from their set point, they can experience extreme discomfort - gender dysphoria. These set points generally cannot be changed and are as intrinsic to a person as eye color, and only method to date for ameliorating dysphoria is to move towards the set point.
                    Some (but not all) nonbinary individuals have set points somewhere in between all-male and all-female. A person at, say, a 40%M-60%F set point might open a 'gender-guesser' smartphone app that listens to their voice pitch or tone and guess they are male with 40% confidence and female with 60% confidence. Some genderfluid people like me experience set points that vary change over time and which change regardless of their will or external factors (comparable to someone whose eyes randomly sometimes look green and sometimes look blue). If genderfluid individuals do not dynamically adapt to their floating set point target, they can get dysphoria.

                     (Note: I've diverged somewhat from proper definitions and conventions. I did so to communicate the basic gist of genderfluidity 
                     to individuals with no prior knowledge of these matters.)
                     YouTube is an amazing resource to learn more about any of these concepts.

                <u>Me as genderfluid</u>:   
                    Genderfluid is an accurate description for me. Fundamentally, I experience the world somewhere between male and female, 
                        between transgender and cisgender, and to fluctuating amounts. Luck of the draw. My set points are about 50-50 on average but vary considerably.
                        They generally change a few times a day.
                    I'm happy and comfortable with this aspect of myself. I'm open to discussions but I'm not your private tutor.

                <u>My pronouns</u>: 
                    I would prefer you avoid 3rd-person singular pronouns altogether when refering to me. Otherwise, use they/them. 
                    They/them pronouns aren't perfect but they are safe options and are always appropriate. 
                    In the English language, gendered terms are the third-person singular pronouns "he, him, his, her, hers, she," and terms like Mr., dude, 
                    police woman, uncle, actress, etc. 
                 Here are some ways to most naturally avoid using pronouns: use my name; use genderless stand-in words 
                 (such as sibling instead of brother or sister); use the passive voice; in person, use nonverbal communication 
                 (hand mannerisms, etc) in combination with 'you'; in casual talk, omit the referent or sentence subject if it is
                 clearly implied or obvious; if you're feeling creative, use an epithet; express your personality and use vocal jargon,
                 abbreviations, or dialect of choice; or (my favorite) rephrase/reword the sentence to avoid pronoun use at all. From 
                 experience, I can say these adaptations become second-nature surprisingly quickly.
                 To be clear, I'm very happy with using other non-gendered pronouns in normal usage, such as I or yourself, to refer to me.

                                        This set point also varies <i>fluidly</i> - sometimes cyclically, sometimes random-seeming, (often distinguishably changing a few times per day, for me). 
                    For example, this morning set point could have been at 40%M-60%F, but at lunchtime has shifted to 55%M-45%F. Usually my set point changes gradually.
                    (Note, other genderfluid individuals might have very different timescales.)
                    If I do not calibrate my behavior towards that floating set point target, I (increasingly) experience extreme discomfort - aka, gender dysphoria.

                    
                    The most friction occurs happens with 
                        individuals I've interacted with directly for more than a half hour but less that about a few dozen hours total. (After that, 
                        others tend to see me as Morgan, not That Genderfluid Person.)
                                I usually present somewhat androgynous in appearance, voice, verbiage, and most aspects of life. 
                                For example, if I'm leaving the house for the day, I'll often wear clothing that can be worn plausibly by either gender, 
                                presenting my authentic self using other means such as emphasizing certain mannerisms.


                 What I really care about is how we interact; using pronouns appropriately is an effective, efficient way for us to achieve that.
                 It's a great way to show your intentions. Mistakes happen and these sorts of adjustment take time for both me and you.

                 interact authentically.
                    and it's a concrete ....

                
                             While I can sometimes fluctuate very near to one of the binaries where a gendered pronoun might make sense, they/them is a reliably *safe* option.

                 The reason I care about pronouns is that it is the best, clearest, easiest way for us to authentically interact. Otherwise, I'll physically feel awful.


                aspect of me is that our interactions do not categorize me as a particular gender, especially with regard to expectations or stereotypes. That doesn't mean I am a "gender nihilist" and refuse ....   
                If in doubt, use your judgment.  Intention is the important thing

                 And while adjusting speech can feel awkward, interacting with me inaccurately can feel just as awkward for both of us.
                Remember, grammer and language is a function of actual usage, not the other way around.
                Gendered pronouns are ultimately not necessary

One translation is, “The Way (Tao) that can be named is not the true Way”; there are <a href=http://www.egreenway.com/taoism/ttclz1.htm>also many other reasonable translations</a>. <!--This seemingly contradictory line captures a stout philosophy of mine that is corroborated by the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic>dialectical method</a> visionary Marsha Linehan: that the most thorough approach to addressing difficult problems comes from distilling, embracing, and understanding the problem's contradictions. Such a philosophy enables a spiritually zen mindset, encourages critical out-of-the-box thinking, and succintly encapsulates my fundamental belief and faith in wisdom and the intellect.

                The philosophy of the Tao Te Ching and especially its first chapter

                This might seem like an absurd answer, being anything but clarifying. But I think it is brilliant, wonderful, and hilarious.

                There are a few immediate realizations from this teacher’s extremely stylistically-<i>Taoist</i> response.
                <ul>
                    <li> The teacher literally <i>does not</i> answer the question, instead obfuscating it. I find it humorous that this religious text that hopes to enlighten begins as a joke.
                    </li>
                    <li> The answer provided is aware of its own absurdity. This text is supposed to explain Taoism to you - yet it contradicts itself immediately by saying it’s inexplicable! By acknowledging this, the line and the text highlight that the answer to such a question is not as important as being cognizant of the question asked — ie, considering questions is more enriching than considering answers. Furthermore, the text, a body of speech, specifically uses the word 可 which means ‘speak’, underscoring its own absurdity and the incompetence of a human’s most powerful means of explanation, speech.
                    </li>
                    <li> The answer provided is paradoxical: either this answer is rejected; or if it is accepted, since the answer entails that the question can’t be answered, then there is no answer to the question! A student of philosophy might observe a self-falsifying belief; a cognitive scientist might recall Gödel, Escher, Bach puzzles.
                    </li>
                    <li> The line’s paradoxical and self-aware nature together cast doubt on the asking of the question in the first place. It shunts the rational and bounded scope of the question, exalting traits of thinking “outside the box” and recognizing that the question is more important than the question’s content. I see this line as expressing fundamental intellectual vitality; embracing true intellectual vitality is the only way to understand the line without ultimate confusion.

                    <li> It’s humbling. To the Icarian reader/listener who is seeking to answer their hardest metaphysical questions, the text requires an omitting of that basic answer-seeking process. As a budding scientist, I think it’s my essential responsibility to stay cognitively aware of and analytical of what science is, instead of embracing a faith in it.

                So: What’s Tao Ke Tao to me? For one, I appreciate the zen-like aesthetic. But more significantly, Tao Ke Tao is a sentinel of some of my core values. Instead of avoiding absurdity, Tao Ke Tao [Fei Chang Tao] embraces absurdity as a means furthering the intellectual discourse and teaching critical self-awareness, with a line (and name) as simple and light as the Tao itself. Also, I find humor in the extra degree of reference of a name Tao Ke Tao that placeholds an entire identity while simultaneously acknowledging how essentially ridiculous those eight letters are.

We probe whether neural networks can learn to plan. We argue that the networks exhibit patterns of learning that resemble human infant findings, and propose an empirically-backed model for how humans cognitively manage reference frames. </p>

                <h2 id="pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h2>

                <p>This course is a requirement for incoming graduate students in the Psychology department. It will be taught in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">R</code> statistical programming language and will be vastly easier if you have some prior experience with the language.</p>

                <p>In addition, we will be relying heavily on version control using git and github. Please take a moment to set up a git account at https://github.com/, and to get it working on your computer before class starts.</p>


                <h2 id="readings">Readings</h2>

                <p>Please complete all readings before the class for which they are assigned. We will be using many of the techniques and workflows described in Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund’s book, <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Scientists</a>, which is available free online. I highly recommend using it as a reference book.</p>

                <! - Two other great books that we will refer to occasionally:

                    * Rosenthal, R., & Rosnow, R. L. (2008). Essentials of behavioral research: Methods and data analysis (3rd ed.). McGraw-Hill. ->
